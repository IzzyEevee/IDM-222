      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Hannah Sami Juraifani and I am an Interactive Digital Media
        major at Drexel University with a minor in Computer Science. I was born in
        Saudi Arabia and raised there for 13 years before moving to the US. I have a
        variety of interests including photography, art, and programming. I'm a fan of
        Pokemon, Anime (in general), Video Games (in general), Cartoons (in general),
        Eeveelutions, and Cats. These things inspire me to be more creative in both my
         art and in my work.

         In terms of my art, I have been drawing since, well, forever but in terms of
         professional, clean work I've been working on that since starting
         college. In this site, you'll see some pieces of my artwork in both
         in my free time and in my classes.
       </p>

         In terms of my work, I am currently a beginner in web design. I hope
         by the time I graduate that I'll be proud of the work to show to my
         potential job offers. This website will showcase my work throughout my
         time here in college.
